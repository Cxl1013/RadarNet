## Tech/framework used

<b>Built using:</b>
- [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org)


## Features

1. <strong>Training:</strong> Model training with built-in database.
2. <strong>Visualization:</strong> Real time visualization of training losses.
3. <strong>Forecasting:</strong> Built in forecasting routine to produce 50 min forecast sequences.


## Installation
<strong>Clone repository:</strong>
`git clone https://github.com/nabimaru/RadarNet`


## Usage
1. ### Training:
To train a new model with your own data use the `train.py` script. The following command line arguments can be passed:  

<strong>-arch:</strong> Neural network architecture to be used. Use 'scd' to train the default Convolution-Deconvolution architecture.  

<strong>-b:</strong> Batch size.  

<strong>-e:</strong> Number of epochs.  

<strong>-op:</strong> Optimizer, insert `Adam` to use the Adam optimizer, `SGD` to stochastic gradient descent.  

<strong>Example of code</strong> : `python train.py -arch scd -b 512 -e 300 -op Adam`

<strong>Output</strong>:

- Model's weights are saved in a file inside the `Models/` folder.
- [Visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom) visualization server shows real-time progress of training and validation loss for every epoch.

2. ### Visualization:
To generate and visualize predictions with your model, run the `viz.py` script with the following commands:

<strong>-arch:</strong> Neural network architecture to be used. Use 'scd' when using Soft Convolution Deconvolution architecture.

<strong>-s:</strong> Starting sequence index from data provided *default=0*.

<strong>-c:</strong> Number of maps to predict *5-minutes forecasting each*.

<strong>-seq:</strong> Type of sequence. Set to 1 to visualize a continuous map sequence with autoregression, 0 to indivudual forecasting for every input.

<strong>Example:</strong> `python viz.py -arch scd -s 600 -c 7 -seq 1`

<strong>Output:</strong>  
- [Visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom) server plots both target and predicted maps.
