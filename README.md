## RadarNet
Deep Learning Convolutional-Deconvolutional framework to short-term climate forecasting


## Introduction
RadarNet provides a 

Axionaut is intended for rapid experimentation, use the built-in Deep Learning architectures and start driving!


## Code style
PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code.

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built using:</b>
- [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org)


## Features

1. <strong>Training mode:</strong> Easy model training with built-in database.
2. <strong>Visualization:</strong> Real time visualization of training Losses.
3. <strong>Forecasting:</strong> Built in forecasting routine to produce 50 min forecast sequences.


## Usage
###1) Training :
In order to train a model on your data, run the train.py script, The following commande line arguments can be passed :
-arch : Neural network architecture to be used. Use 'scd' to train a Soft Convolution Deconvolution architecture.
-b : Batch size
-e : Number of epochs
-op : Optimizer. Use 'Adam' to use the Adam optimizer, 'SGD' to use the stochastic gradient descent optimizer.
<strong>Example</strong> : python train.py -arch scd -b 512 -e 300 -op Adam
<strong>Output</strong> : 
- Your model's weights will be saved in a file inside the 'Models' folder.
- The Visdom window shows the progress of the loss real-time for every epoch

###1) Visualization :

## Code Exemple

The following commands are avaliable when using the main.py example:

<strong>Start vehicle on self-driving mode:</strong>
`python main.py mode self_driving`

<strong>Start on recording mode:</strong>
`python main.py mode record`

<strong>Start on free ride mode:</strong>
`python main.py mode free`

<strong>To train your own driving model:</strong>
`python main.py mode train architecture ConvNets epochs 100 batch size 300 optimizer Adam`

Feel free to explore and set your prefered training hyperparameters!
