## RadarNet
Deep Learning Convolutional-Deconvolutional framework to short-term climate forecasting


## Introduction
RadarNet implements of a Convolution Deconvolution Neural Network (CDNN) to short-term forecasting of precipitation and estimate the advection field using the CDNN architecture and obtain future maps by applying warping techniques. 

## Code style
PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code.

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built using:</b>
- [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org)


## Features

1. <strong>Training:</strong> Model training with built-in database.
2. <strong>Visualization:</strong> Real time visualization of training Losses.
3. <strong>Forecasting:</strong> Built in forecasting routine to produce 50 min forecast sequences.


## Usage
<h3>1) Training :</h3>
In order to train a model on your data, run the train.py script, The following commande line arguments can be passed :</br>
-arch : Neural network architecture to be used. Use 'scd' to train a Soft Convolution Deconvolution architecture.</br>
-b : Batch size.</br>
-e : Number of epochs.</br>
-op : Optimizer. Use 'Adam' to use the Adam optimizer, 'SGD' to use the stochastic gradient descent optimizer.</br>
<strong>Example</strong> : python train.py -arch scd -b 512 -e 300 -op Adam</br>
<strong>Output</strong> : </br>
- Your model's weights will be saved in a file inside the 'Models' folder.
- The Visdom window shows the progress of the loss real-time for every epoch

<h3>1) Visualization :</h3>
To make some predictions with the just trained model, we can run the viz.py script to :</br>
-arch : Neural network architecture to be used. Use 'scd' if you are loading a models that have been trained on a Soft Convolution Deconvolution architecture.</br>
-s : Data index to start the forecasts from.</br>
-c : Number of forecasts to do.</br>
-seq : Should be put to 1 if we want to visualize a continious sequence of forecasts with autoregression, and 0 if we want to have indivudual one forecasts for every input.</br>

<strong>Example</strong> : python viz.py -arch scd -s 600 -c 7 -seq 1</br>
<strong>Output</strong> : </br>
- The Visdom window shows the real maps that should be predicted alongside the forecasts starting from '-s' untill '-s' + '-c'
